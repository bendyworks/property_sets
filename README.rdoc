= Property sets

This gem is a way for you to use a basic "key/value" store for storing attributes for a given model in a relational fashion where there's a row per attribute. Alternatively you'd need to add a new column per attribute to your main table, or serialize the attributes and their values.

== Description

You configure the allowed stored properties by specifying these in the model:

  class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    property_set :settings do
      property :version, :default => "v1.0"
      property :featured
      property :product
    end

    property_set :texts do
      property :epilogue
    end
  end

The declared properties can then be accessed runtime via the defined association:

  # Return the version record for this account - or a new record if none exists
  account.settings.version

  # Create (or update) the version record with default value
  account.settings.version.create

  # Create (or update) the version record with the given value
  account.settings.version.create(:value => "v1.1")

  # Destroy the version record
  account.settings.version.destroy

On top of the basic access paths, there are some short cuts, mainly convenience methods for dealing with booleans:

  # immediately changes the value of the setting
  account.settings.version=("v3.0")

  # coerces the setting to boolean AR style
  account.settings.featured?

  # sets the value of this setting to a true value
  account.settings.featured.enable

  # sets the value of this setting to a false value
  account.settings.featured.disable

Stored properties can also be updated with the update_attributes and update_attributes! methods by
enabling nested attributes. Like this (from the test cases):

  @account.texts_attributes = [
    { :name => "foo", :value => "1"  },
    { :name => "bar", :value => "0"  }
  ]

And for existing records:

  @account.update_attributes!(:texts_attributes => [
    { :id => @account.texts.foo.id, :name => "foo", :value => "0"  },
    { :id => @account.texts.bar.id, :name => "bar", :value => "1" }
  ])


== Installation

Install the gem in your rails project by putting it in your Gemfile:

  gem "property_sets"

Also remember to create the storage table(s), if for example you are going to be using this with an accounts model and a "settings" property set, you can define the table like:

  create_table :account_settings do |t|
    t.integer  :account_id, :null => false
    t.string   :name, :null => false
    t.string   :value
    t.timestamps
  end

  add_index :account_settings, [ :account_id, :name ], :unique => true
